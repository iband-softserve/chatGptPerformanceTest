Write me a description of an application that uses this API https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all to get data and allows user to filter data by country name and population, sort data by country name, paginate data. The description should contain only 2 paragraphs and 4-10 sentences.

ChatGPT
Our application, "CountryExplorer", harnesses the power of the REST Countries API to deliver insightful information about all the countries globally, making it the go-to solution for geography enthusiasts and international travelers alike. Once the user opens the application, it calls the API at https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all to get the complete list of countries. Users can easily search for a specific country by entering the country name, and the application filters the data accordingly, showing relevant details such as population, area, and various other demographic and geographic details.

Furthermore, the application facilitates easy browsing through the addition of population filters and the capability to sort the list of countries alphabetically. Whether you're looking for populous nations or tranquil havens with fewer inhabitants, the population filter is a valuable tool. The sorting feature allows users to organize the data either in ascending or descending order based on the country's name, providing a user-friendly experience. Lastly, the application provides pagination for the dataset, making the navigation through a large number of countries more manageable and less overwhelming for the user.

Can you make it more suitable for a README file so I can upload it to my github repository?

CountryExplorer
CountryExplorer is an application that leverages the REST Countries API (https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all) to fetch data and deliver insightful details about all countries globally. Designed with a user-friendly interface, this application makes the exploration of countries a seamless task for geography enthusiasts and international travelers.

Users can search for a specific country by entering the country name in the search bar, whereupon the application filters and displays relevant country-specific data. You can also filter countries based on population and sort the list of countries alphabetically for a more organized browsing experience. We've also incorporated pagination to manage the navigation through the extensive list of countries effectively, providing a manageable and less overwhelming user experience. Feel free to fork, clone, or contribute to this repository to enhance this project further!

write me instructions on how to run dotnet WebAPI locally so I can use it for the README file in my github repository
ChatGPT
Running the DotNet WebAPI Locally
To run the DotNet WebAPI project locally, follow the instructions below:

Prerequisites:
.NET Core SDK: The project is built with .NET Core, so you will need to install the .NET Core SDK. You can download it from here: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download.

A text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Visual Studio Code (VS Code) or Visual Studio 2019 (or later) are recommended.

Steps:
Clone the repository: First, you need to clone the repository to your local machine. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

git clone <repository_url>
Replace <repository_url> with the URL of your GitHub repository.

Navigate to the project directory: After cloning the repository, navigate to the project directory (the folder containing the .csproj file) using the command:

cd <project_directory_path>
Replace <project_directory_path> with the path of your project directory.

Restore the packages: Run the following command to restore all the NuGet packages used in the project:

dotnet restore
Build the project: Next, build the project using the following command:

dotnet build
Run the project: Finally, run the project with this command:

dotnet run
After you've run the dotnet run command, the console will output the localhost URL where your WebAPI is being hosted (typically something like http://localhost:5000 or https://localhost:5001). You can now use this URL to access your local WebAPI.

Remember to stop the API from running when you're done by pressing CTRL+C in your terminal or command prompt.

Write me 10 examples of how to use the endpoint of application you described earlier. 
Url for this endpoint: https://localhost:5000/Country/All
Query properties that this endpoint can handle: 
string? name (filter by countryName)
int? population (filter by countryPopulation)
string? sortType ('ascend' or 'descend' sorting)
int? numberOfRecords (how many records should be returned in response)
ChatGPT
Sure, here are ten examples of how you can use the endpoint of the application:

Getting All Records: Simply access the endpoint without any filters to get all records:

https://localhost:5000/Country/All
Filtering by Country Name: If you want to search for a specific country, say 'Germany', you can use the 'name' query property:

https://localhost:5000/Country/All?name=Germany
Filtering by Population: To get countries with a population less than or equal to 1 million, use the 'population' query:

https://localhost:5000/Country/All?population=1000000
Sorting in Ascending Order: To sort the countries by name in ascending order, use the 'sortType' query:

https://localhost:5000/Country/All?sortType=ascend
Sorting in Descending Order: To sort the countries by name in descending order, use the 'sortType' query:

https://localhost:5000/Country/All?sortType=descend
Limiting the Number of Records: To limit the number of records returned in response, use the 'numberOfRecords' query. For example, to get only 5 countries, use:

https://localhost:5000/Country/All?numberOfRecords=5
Combining Queries: You can also combine multiple queries. For example, to get 3 countries with a population greater than 50 million, sorted in ascending order, use:

https://localhost:5000/Country/All?population=50000000&sortType=ascend&numberOfRecords=3
Filtering by Country Name and Sorting: To find a country, say 'India', and sort it in descending order, use:

https://localhost:5000/Country/All?name=India&sortType=descend
Filtering by Population and Limiting Records: To get 10 countries with a population less than 1 billion, use:

https://localhost:5000/Country/All?population=1000000000&numberOfRecords=10
Using all Queries Together: To get 2 countries with names starting with 'A', with a population less than 10 million, sorted in descending order, use:

https://localhost:5000/Country/All?name=A&population=10000000&sortType=descend&numberOfRecords=2
Remember to replace 'localhost:5000' with your server's address if you're not running the application locally.
